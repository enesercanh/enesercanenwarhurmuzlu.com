                <h2>Welcome to My World</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Enes, a dreamer, innovator, and changemaker from Iraq. My life has been a journey of exploration and passion for learning, spanning mathematics, education, technology, and social impact. Let me share my story with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up in Baghdad, I always dreamed of making a difference. As the founder of <strong>We Change</strong>, a non-governmental organization, I've worked tirelessly to provide extracurricular opportunities for young people in Iraq. From charity events to book clubs and educational trips, We Change aims to empower youth and spark hope for a brighter future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey took a new turn when I was selected to participate in the <strong>Yale Young Global Scholars program</strong>, where I delved into solving global challenges. I have also represented my country at the <strong>International Mathematical Olympiad</strong>, with a dream of earning gold and inspiring others to pursue excellence in mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My vision doesn't stop there. Iâ€™m working on innovative projects like a public transportation app for Baghdad, aiming to revolutionize urban mobility, and creating engaging math content to make learning fun and accessible. I aspire to study at prestigious institutions like MIT and Cambridge, driven by a desire to turn my ideas into impactful solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond academics and technology, I am passionate about uniting people through shared values and diversity. My upcoming book, dedicated to showcasing Iraq's beauty and resilience, is a testament to my belief in the power of unity and understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
