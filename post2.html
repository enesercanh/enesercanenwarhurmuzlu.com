        <p>Today was a special day. It made me look at the world a bit differently. From the beginning I always loved working on things mostly alone especially important projects, that doesn’t mean I lacked teamwork, but I loved doing most things alone so I can have peaceful life without negotiations or any sort of that. But here I am working really for an important step in my life for a while but I came to realization without help this can’t happen and wouldn’t even takes place. I took a bit of time to think about person who can help me on this subject. Took a lot of time without contacting. Maybe overthinked about some people as it needed expertise, professionalism, time, passion, and persistency. Some friends are already excluded because of their time commitment and others excluded as either they are very old for this or highly likely they will not even consider it. Until recently in Eid when I saw my cousin Mohammed -a big supporter of mine from my humble beginning- where we talked about various subjects where I realized how we were very close with our mindsets.</p>
        <p>The very next day I texted him and we arranged a meet today and now he not only will be supporter inside the work but will be a whole partner! Sometimes we just overthink a lot to the point we miss out the most close to us. I am happy that my partner is not only with my same mindset but a close family member.</p>
        <p><img src="me_and_mohammed.jpg" alt="Me and Mohammed"></p>
        <p>I believe that this not only happens with people but with subjects, and professions. Instead of solving Nim-sum problem in combinatorial math lets first understand the logic of nim-sum before applying it. I post this as an appreciation of how our lifes are structured and how sometimes we need to come back to the basics.</p>
        <p>I guess I wasn’t aware of this much but now looking at it from this perspective makes all the things better I guess. When I was in 10th grade I brought 1st place in the INPO (Iraq National Project Olympiad) After being in the first place what was supposed to happen was basically go to ISEF (International Science & Engineering Fair) to represent my own project. At that time the school asked me to give them 5000 $ for the whole trip everything included but I knew myself that the situation I won’t be able to make this happen to go to ISEF even though I knew that I am sure that I would bring something big from ISEF I couldn’t handle to sacrifice it because what if I didn’t. So I just didn’t go and last year because I was afraid that the admission officers would see that I couldn’t afford to go to ISEF so I just said I had visa issues. Now this year I also became an ISEF finalist. But I think life is repeating the same thing. I talked to a guy who went to ISEF last year and he said that he payed a freaking 6500 $. Sorry but not sorry I think this is out of the question.</p>
        <p>On the other hand my mom told me to go with the money that she has been saving for years to at least be able to buy a plot of land on the outskirts of Baghdad. Sorry but if that what it takes to go to ISEF I would be the first one to reject it. I mean if college rejects me because I didn’t go to ISEF so be it they don’t want me then. Although I might be also qualified to Genius Olympiad that will take place in University of Rochester and Vilipo in Lithuania I think I wouldn’t care less about them if they require me money. In the next day my priotities are for academics, prepare for IMO and SAT. And I will add to these to search for a land to buy for my mom. I believe this is the best decision that I can take. I think this would be sacrifice for the better. And I believe there would be a lot more situations like this in my life that I should give up something particular for the better.</p>
