        <p>I guess I wasn’t aware of this much but now looking at it from this perspective makes all the things better I guess. When I was in 10th grade I brought 1st place in the INPO (Iraq National Project Olympiad) After being in the first place what was supposed to happen was basically go to ISEF (International Science & Engineering Fair) to represent my own project. At that time the school asked me to give them 5000 $ for the whole trip everything included but I knew myself that the situation I am in won’t be able to make this happen to go to ISEF even though I knew that I am sure that I would bring something big from ISEF I couldn’t handle to sacrifice it because what if I didn’t. So I just didn’t go and last year because I was afraid that the admission officers would see that I couldn’t afford to go to ISEF so I just said I had visa issues. Now this year I also became an ISEF finalist. But I think life is repeating the same thing. I talked to a guy who went to ISEF last year and he said that he payed a freaking 6500 $. Sorry but not sorry I think this is out of the question. 
On the other hand my mom told me to go with the money that she has been saving for years to at least be able to buy a plot of land on the outskirts of Baghdad. Sorry but if that what it takes to go to ISEF I would be the first one to reject it. I mean if college rejects me because I didn’t go to ISEF so be it they don’t want me then. Although I might be also qualified to Genius Olympiad that will take place in University of Rochester and Vilipo in Lithuania I think I wouldn’t care less about them if they require me money. In the next day my priotities are to check which school I will end up going to to finish high school 25-26, prepare for IMO and SAT. And I will add to these to search for a land to buy for my mom. I believe this is the best decision that I can take. I think this would  be sacrifice for the better. And I believe there would be a lot more situations like this in my life that I should give up something particular for the better.</p>
